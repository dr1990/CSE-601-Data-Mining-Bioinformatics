Steps to run -

Naive Bayes:
a. To run with dataset 1 and 2 in normal mode:
	1. Set 'performCrossFold' and 'performErrorCorrection' to 'True' on lines 8 and 9 of NaiveBayes.py respectively.
	2. Open terminal and run command - python NaiveBayes.py
b. To run with dataset 4 in demo mode:
	1. Set 'performCrossFold' and 'performErrorCorrection' to 'False'on lines 8 and 9 of NaiveBayes.py respectively.
	2. Open terminal and run command - python NaiveBayes.py
	3. Provide test input. (e.g. - rain,hot,high,weak)
